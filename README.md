### Client Side

- <b>paypal/react-paypal-js ^7.8.1 :</b> react-paypal-js provides a solution to developers to abstract away complexities around loading the JS SDK. It enforces best practices by default so buyers get the best possible user experience. In our app, we use the PayPalScriptProvider options prop to configure the JS SDK, and allows client can complete payment in Paypal sanbox environment.
- <b>reduxjs/toolkit ^1.8.3 :</b> Includes utilities to simplify common use cases like store setup, creating reducers, immutable update logic, and more.Provides good defaults for store setup out of the box, and includes the most commonly used Redux addons built-in. In our app, we use redux to lift up 4 different products states, users states and order states to global state.
- <b>react-redux ^8.0.2 :</b> React Redux is the official React binding for Redux. It allows React components to read data from a Redux Store, and dispatch Actions to the Store to update data. In our app, you will find we used useDispatch, useSelector to dispatch actions to each related component to update state data.
- <b>axios ^0.27.2 :</b> Axios is a Javascript library used to perform HTTP requests for Nodejs and browsers. It supports the Promise API and makes it easy to send requests asynchronously. In our app, we use axios.create to create a new instance of axios with our config. Then our client, auth and admin system makes GET/POST/PUT/DELETE HTTP requests using the axios instance.
- <b>react ^18.2.0 :</b> React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies. Our application dynamic client side UI is built with the react labs.
- <b>react-bootstrap ^2.4.0 :</b> React-Bootstrap is a component-based library that provides native Bootstrap components as pure React components. Our application UI layout is mainly used with React-Bootstrap.
- <b>react-dom ^18.2.0 :</b> ReactDOM is a package that provides DOM specific methods that can be used at the top level of a web app to enable an efficient way of managing DOM elements of the web page. This enables our app can use render() method to render components in the browser.
- <b>react-helmet ^6.1.0 :</b> React Helmet is a component to dynamically manage the document's head section. Some common use cases include setting the title , description , and meta tags for the document. In our app, when users go to each different main component, they will find each title also is different. For example, if user in the app home page, they can find the title: Welcome to Tas Resort | Home.
- <b>react-helmet-async ^1.3.0 :</b> React Helmet Async is a component which lets us control our document head using their React component. We use this lab to fixed some console error issues.
- <b>react-multi-carousel ^2.8.2 :</b> A lightweight production-ready Carousel that rocks supports multiple items and server-side rendering with no dependency. We mainly use it to make food list and specialty list screen UI layouts are different.
- <b>react-router-bootstrap ^0.26.2 :</b> The lab is integration between React Router v6 and React Bootstrap. In our app, we use LinkContainer to wrap our react bootstrap element to make it behave like a react router Link.
- <b>react-router-dom ^6.3.0 :</b> React Router DOM enables us to implement dynamic routing in our app. It allows for conditional rendering of our app's components in a single-page application based on the route being used in the URL. For example, in our different product screen component, we use navigateTo(-1) to allow users to click the go back button and always go gack to the previous page. If user clicks the product card to check product details from the home page, then when they click the go back button, they will go back to the home page, but if they check product details from the product list page, the go back button will take them back to the product list page.
- <b>react-scripts 5.0.1 :</b> react-scripts are simply scripts to run the build tools required to transform React JSX syntax into plain JavaScript programmatically.
- <b>react-toastify ^9.0.7 :</b> This lab allows us to add notifications to our app with ease. In our app, we mainly import this lab into action files, for example, when a user makes an order successfully, they will find a notification on the page, we think this can enhance the UI experience.
- <b>redux-devtools-extension ^2.13.9 :</b> We use this lab for debugging our application's state changes. We have used this lab and chrome redux devtools in our development environment to monitor actions and states change.
- <b>testing-library/jest-dom ^5.14.1 :</b> jest-dom is a companion library for Testing Library that provides custom DOM element matchers for Jest. In our app, we mainly use jest lab to do unit test in frontend.
- <b>testing-library/react ^13.0.0 :</b> React Testing Library is a testing utility tool that's built to test the actual DOM tree rendered by React on the browser. The goal of the library is to us write tests that resemble how a user would use our application.
- <b>testing-library/user-event ^13.2.1 :</b> user-event is a companion library for Testing Library that simulates user interactions by dispatching the events that would happen if the interaction took place in a browser.

### Server Side

- <b>bcryptjs ^2.4.3 :</b> It helps to avoid the sensitive data being visible from anyone. For security reason, we use this module to storing of user's password as hashed password instead of plaintext.
- <b>cors ^2.8.5 :</b> We use CORS to allow cross-origin access. CORS is a part of HTTP that lets our app server specify any other hosts from which a browser should permit loading of content.
- <b>cloudinary ^1.30.1 :</b> The Cloudinary Node SDK allows us to quickly and easily integrate our application with Cloudinary. In our app, when user upload image from frontend, the image will be stored in cloud, our backend database only store the image cloud URL.
- <b>dotenv ^16.0.1 :</b> DotEnv is a lightweight npm package that automatically loads environment variables from a . env file into the process. env object. In our app, we use it to config some sensitive data such as database and cloud keys.

## :scroll: Project and Task Management

We adopted an agile approach to manage this project with task management done through the use of a Trello board.

In the initial planning phase of the project, we met with our client Tasmania Resort to gather their requirements for this project and collected user stories to help conceptualise ideas for features and functions.

At the start of the development phase, we had a high level meeting to discuss how the project was going to be managed. We decided to continue using the agile approach of splitting the workflow into sprints based on the priority of tasks.

We revisited the user stories in detail and decided to split the project into 4 sprints of 5 days each.

- Sprint 1: Create MVP(minimum viable product).
  In this sprint, we built the basic overall structure of the website consisting of all essential functions(all priority 1) and basic UI. We came across a couple of blockers such as how to best set up our product schemas. We called meetings to talk through these issues and were able to resolve these quickly which led to a successful delivery of the MVP by the end of sprint 1.

- Sprint 2: Priority 2 features and functions.
  We tried to implement features that are ranked priority 2 during this sprint. We encountered some blockers that delayed our progress and by the second half of the sprint, we realised that we will need to review the remaining features to be implemented in this sprint as it was unlikely that we would be able to implement them all. Our team first had an internal discussion regarding which features may need to be put into the backlog to be worked on at a later date. Then we met with our client to communicate these delays and reprioritised tasks according to the client's preference. Our client was happy to leave the 'edit profile picture' feature to be implemented at a later date.

- Sprint 3: Refactor code, improve UI, manual, unit and integration tests, deployment
  With all features and functions

- Sprint 4: Complete all documentation

Before the start of each sprint, we had a sprint planning meeting to go over the goals and tasks of the upcoming sprint to ensure everyone in the team is on the same page with what our priorities are.

- daily stand up meetings to discuss how we should tackle tasks that are being worked on, any blocks, what will be worked on next

- sprint review meetings are held at the end of each sprint, we ran through the completed features with client to get feedback to determine if any adjustments need to be made.

In each of the sprint planning meetings, we reviewed the cards to ensure that they were prioritised and so that each card was of a similar size (where possible) at the time that it is picked up to be worked on. We did this on an informal basis, referring to them in tshirt sizes (S, M, L). As we added features and functions to the board, we progressively broke them down into individual tasks and assigned each task to a specific team member (or in some cases as described below, to multiple team members).

From the start we identified that our team was very well rounded in terms of relative levels of skill with regards to the various aspects of this project (e.g. front end, back end, and design) and so we didn't have to consider how to balance the relative strengths and weaknesses of each team member, and in fact we made a conscious decision not to do so. As a result our main goal was to ensure an even exposure to each team member across each of these areas. Whilst our process did facilitate this, being a small team allowed us flexibility in terms of process that we used to allow team members the ability to follow through on a particular feature or logical group of features within a given area where it made sense to do so (e.g. continuing to work on front end styling because it may be easier for the same team member to continue doing work that they are already familiar with) to facilitate greater efficiency.

For some of the more difficult tasks, or for those that were more difficult to split up into multiple smaller tasks we used a 'pair programming' approach (but with 3 people instead of 2) to ensure that all team members understood the codebase, and had the opoortunity to provide input on important parts of the code that would affect each of our individual tasks later.
