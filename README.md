# Project Management

We adopted an agile approach to manage this project with task management done through the use of a Trello board.

In the initial planning phase of the project, we met with our client Tasmania Resort to gather their requirements for this project and collected user stories to help conceptualise ideas for features and functions.

At the start of the development phase, we had a high level sprint planning meeting to discuss how the project was going to be managed. We decided to continue using the agile approach of splitting the workflow into sprints based on the priority of tasks.

We revisted the user stories in detail and decided to split the project into 4 sprints of 5 days each.

Sprint 1: Create MVP(minimum viable product). It should consist of all essential functions(all priority 1) and basic UI;
Sprint 2: Complete all priority 2 functions.
Sprint 3: Refactor code, improve UI, tests, deployment
Sprint 4: Complete all documentation

Before the start of each sprint, we had a sprint planning meeting to go over the goals and tasks of the upcoming sprint to ensure everyone in the team is on the same page with what our priorities are.

- daily stand up meetings to discuss how we should tackle tasks that are being worked on, any blocks, what will be worked on next

- backlog refinement meeting - only held for sprint 2 where we fell a little behind in delivering the second priority features for the website. In this meeting, our development team had an internal discussion regarding which features may need to be put into the backlog to be worked on at a later date. Then we met with our client to communicate these delays and reprioritised according to the client's needs.

- sprint review meetings are held at the end of each sprint, our team got together to run through the completed features with client and
